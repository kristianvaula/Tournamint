## Tournament Administration Application
#### Group project from "*Systemutvikling 1*", a course we had in our second semester. 

This was a project we worked on throughout most of the semester. We created a amateur tournament administration application. The course has a big focus on learning how to develop a project as a group through agile development methodology and careful planning. Coding and the raw software itself counted for 25% of the grade-basis, while the rest was based things like: 
- Different stages of planning
- Process of working as a team 
- Developing a vision document, different models and diagrams, user manual and project report.
- \+ More 

My role was being the team-leader for our group, as well as working mostly on coding the program, perhaps espacially the graphical user interface and its connection to the underlaying code. 

### The whole project is found on [GitLab](https://gitlab.stud.idi.ntnu.no/kristvje/idatt1002_2022_k1-g01.git)
